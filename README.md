# Delegate, Func and Action in C#
## How to use Delegate, Func and Action In C#

This C# code demonstrates the usage of delegates, Func and Action delegates, and anonymous methods.

The code begins with invoking the 'RelaxingOnTheBeach()' method with three different delegate methods, 'DrinkWater()', 'DrinkBeer()', and 'DrinkLemonade()', as well as invoking the Run() method with the DrinkWater() delegate.

Next, a delegate 'DrinkAction' is created with the 'DrinkBeer()' method passed as an argument, and is then invoked.

The code then demonstrates the usage of Func delegates to perform addition and subtraction operations. An anonymous method is also used with the 'getRandomNumber()' function to generate a random number between 1 and 100.

Finally, the code demonstrates the usage of Action delegates by defining a 'PrintNumber()' method which prints an integer value to the console. This method is then invoked with two integer arguments, 5 and 8.

Overall, the code shows how delegates, Func and Action delegates, and anonymous methods can be used to create reusable code blocks and provide flexibility in programming.
